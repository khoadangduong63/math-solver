# Behavioural Questions

## 1. What attracted you to our startup?

- I am truly inspired by Growtrics' vision of redefining the learning experience through AI-powered personalized education. What excites me most is the chance to contribute directly to a product that not only embraces cutting-edge technology but also delivers a meaningful impact on learners' lives. I strongly resonate with your mission, as I believe education should be accessible to everyone, and effective learning should feel like a transformative and enjoyable journey.

- Joining a startup at this early stage means having the opportunity to build alongside the team from the ground up—laying the foundations today that will support a strong and scalable platform in the future. I see this not only as a chance to grow technically and professionally, but also as a way to channel my passion for education technology into something that creates long-term value for both the company and society. For me, that is the kind of challenge worth dedicating my career to.


## 2. Where do you see yourself 5 years from now?

- In the next five years, I see myself evolving into a leading expert in AI and backend engineering, while taking on greater responsibilities such as managing a technical team or driving large-scale projects. My long-term aspiration is to become a Solution Architect — someone who can design end-to-end systems and define the strategic direction of technology. I believe this path will not only allow me to deepen my technical expertise but also to create long-term value by shaping solutions that truly make an impact. The opportunity to architect strategy and technology together is what excites me most about the future.”


## 3. Why did you leave your previous jobs (if applicable)? 

- I decided to leave my previous role because the company’s projects had shifted away from AI, which is the core direction I want to pursue in my career. At the same time, I was looking for a more innovative environment where I could challenge myself and make a stronger impact that aligns with my long-term goals. I truly value the experience and lessons I gained from my former company, but I believe now is the right time to move on to an opportunity where I can fully apply my expertise and passion for AI.


## 4. How do you think education can be improved with technology and why? 

- I believe technology, especially AI, can make education truly personalized. Instead of applying a single path for everyone, AI can design learning journeys tailored to each student’s pace and interests. I really resonate with the saying: "Don’t judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree." Every individual has unique potential, and when placed in the right environment, they can thrive like a hidden gem waiting to be discovered. Traditional education often focuses on the majority, leaving those who are different feeling overlooked. AI can change that. Moreover, online platforms powered by AI can expand access to knowledge for people everywhere, regardless of their economic or geographic limitations.


## 5. If your friends or former employer were asked to comment on 3 good traits and 3 bad traits about you, what would they say and why?

- My colleagues and former managers would likely highlight three strengths. First, my strong sense of responsibility, because I always take ownership of tasks and see them through to completion. Second, my problem-solving skills, as I tend to remain calm under pressure and focus on finding practical solutions. Third, my ability to collaborate well in teams, since I am always willing to share knowledge and support others when needed.

- On the other hand, they might also mention three weaknesses. One is being a bit of a perfectionist, because I often want everything to be done flawlessly. Another is taking on too much at once, since I sometimes hesitate to delegate or ask for help. And finally, occasional self-doubt, because I tend to set very high standards for myself. That said, I’ve been actively improving by prioritizing tasks more effectively, delegating when appropriate, and building confidence in my decisions through consistent practice.


## 6. If you could buy a billboard anywhere around the world, what would it say and where would it be?

- If I could buy a billboard anywhere in the world, it would say: ‘No Wi-Fi here. Talk to each other.’ I’d place it in a busy public space like a train station or an airport, where thousands of people cross paths every day.

- The reason I love this message is that it works on multiple levels. On the surface, it’s humorous — because in today’s world, we almost panic when there’s no Wi-Fi. But deeper than that, it’s a social commentary: we live in a time where we are more connected than ever digitally, yet often more disconnected from the people right beside us. This phrase is a playful reminder that real human connection — a conversation, a laugh, even eye contact — is far more valuable than another hour of scrolling.

- I also like how the message is universally relatable. It doesn’t matter who you are, where you’re from, or what language you speak — everyone understands the Wi-Fi obsession. That makes the billboard instantly recognizable and impactful.

- And if I had the chance, I’d even take it one step further and sell this idea as a clever ad campaign for chewing gum or a mouth spray brand. Because if people are going to talk to each other more, they’ll definitely want fresh breath. That combination of humor, cultural relevance, and subtle marketing makes the message not only simple and funny but also memorable in a way that sticks with people long after they walk away


## 7. What do you believe is true, but can’t prove?

- I believe imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge takes us to what is already known, but imagination opens doors to what has never been seen. History shows that humanity’s greatest leaps have always started with bold imagination.

- I also believe that everything in the universe is connected through energy. When someone carries strong energy, they can tap into dimensions that are usually inaccessible. Tesla and Einstein both described finding answers in their dreams, as if entering a vast library of solutions. Leonardo da Vinci is another example — his seemingly impossible ideas eventually laid the groundwork for human progress. To me, all of this illustrates how imagination, combined with creative energy, can unlock breakthroughs that change the world.
